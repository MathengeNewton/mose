                    The property is situated on the southern unfenced borders of Nairobi National Park. We have plenty
                    of
                    game all year round as well as a resident bush baby (Bo-Jangles) and an Egyptian goose couple (Gus &
                    Frieda).
                    The guest loft occupies the second floor of the house and has a private terrace offering beautiful
                    views
                    on garden and park. The en suite bathroom features a spacious shower, vanity area and a beautiful
                    bathtub which is perfectly placed for our famous 'bathtub game viewing' - a very unique luxury, only
                    the
                    Kampi offers in the entire Nairobi National Park area.
                    At the Kampi you will be served breakfast. For lunch & dinner you have full access to a generously
                    spaced kitchen with all amenities, including your own fridge and storage space. If you arrange your
                    transfer to the Kampi with us, a stop for shopping at the Hardy Post/ Hardy Provision Store (a very
                    well
                    assorted deli supermarket in Karen) is included in the transport fare. Take-away meals may also be
                    ordered from the restaurants in the environs.
                    Guests may use the entire house including living room with fireplace, kitchen, dining, terrace and
                    the
                    ample garden as well as a dedicated car shelter if required. I live at the Kampi and will be sharing
                    the
                    premises with you.
